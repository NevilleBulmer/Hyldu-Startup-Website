# Hyldu-Startup-Website

Its features include:

•	Sing up.
•	Login.
•	Password reset.
•	Clients list.
•	Add / remove clients.
•	Customizable account types.

This website also had a mobile application component built using AngularJS, the concept was for putting developers in touch with people who had ideas for applications which they may need developed.

The website is sadly no longer running as the CEO abandoned the project once the prototype was finished and was handed off.

The websites from end were built using AngularJS, this was done to keep the development methodology consistent 
and cohesive across the website and the mobile application.

The backend of the application was an extensive RESTful API built entirely in vanilla PHP and following a singleton 
pattern.
